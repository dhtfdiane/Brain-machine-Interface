This repository contains my group work for the Imperial College London "BMIS" module (2023-2024).

## Task
We were provided with a dataset of multi-channel ECoG recordings from a monkey during a reaching task. With this dataset, we carried out a neural decoding task, aiming to predict the dynamics of the monkey's arm, as well as to classify the direction of reach of the monkey (from 8 possible targets) in real-time.

## Approach
The approach is described in the report pdf provided.
